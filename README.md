## Game Rules

1. **Players**:
   - The game is played by **2 players**. Each player will take turns rolling dice.

2. **Gameplay**:
   - **Rolling the Dice**: On their turn, a player can roll the dice as many times as they wish. Each roll's result is added to the **ROUND score**.
   - **Risk of Rolling a 1**: If a player rolls a **1** on any roll, they **lose all points** accumulated during that round. The round ends immediately, and it's the next playerâ€™s turn.
   - **Holding**: If a player is satisfied with their accumulated **ROUND score**, they can choose to **'Hold'**. When they choose to hold:
     - Their **ROUND score** is added to their **GLOBAL score**.
     - The turn ends, and it's the next player's turn.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The game continues until one player reaches **100 points** in their **GLOBAL score**.
   - The first player to reach 100 points wins the game!

## Example of a Turn

1. **Player A's Turn**:
   - Player A rolls the dice and gets a 4. Their **ROUND score** is now 4.
   - Player A rolls again and gets a 6. Their **ROUND score** is now 10 (4 + 6).
   - Player A rolls again and gets a 1. Since they rolled a 1, **all** the points accumulated during this turn are lost, and it's now **Player B's turn**.

2. **Player B's Turn**:
   - Player B rolls the dice and gets a 5. Their **ROUND score** is now 5.
   - Player B rolls again and gets a 3. Their **ROUND score** is now 8 (5 + 3).
   - Player B chooses to **'Hold'**, so their **ROUND score (8)** is added to their **GLOBAL score**, and it's now **Player A's turn**.

## Tips & Strategy

- **Risk vs. Reward**: The key to winning is balancing risk and reward. Keep an eye on your opponentâ€™s score, and decide whether to risk rolling again or hold to secure your points.
- **Watch Out for the 1!**: A single roll of 1 can wipe out an entire round's progress, so always consider the potential for losing your points when deciding how many times to roll.
